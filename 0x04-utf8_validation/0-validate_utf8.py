"""
Write a method that determines if a given data set represents
a valid UTF-8 encoding.
  - Prototype: def validUTF8(data)
  - Return: True if data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else return False
  - A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long
  - The data set can contain multiple characters
  - The data will be represented by a list of integers
  - Each integer represents 1 byte of data, therefore you only
    need to handle the 8 least significant bits of each integer
